* there is a bug in cinoutdep when executing serially: arg_ini_ready grabs
  lock but release is never called.

* cleanup functors code: all of them should be workable without the MetaData
  template type argument, as we can figure out MetaData from the DepTy.

* object.h: error in obj_payload in padding declaration.

* count number of times something is renamed, how many in,out,in/out args

* in debugging mode, check that all spawns have finished
  in split_return - similar to implicit sync, but fail, don't sync.

* consider inout renaming for the benefit of cholesky2 (or critical)

* optimization for ini_ready() check on multiple objects.
  Observation: head > tail (unless wrap-around)
  Thus: bool_eval empty() { return (bool_eval*)this; }
        operator && ( bool_eval e ) { uint64_t b = ( (*(uint64_t)this) + ((uint64_t)e) );
		return (b >> 32) == b & ((1<<31)-1);
		OR:
		return b.hi == b.lo; where struct { lo; hi; } b;
		}
  *AND* change wf_arg_ready() to allow non-short-circuit check on readiness
  ? From what number of arguments on could this be faster?
  ? What is the potential damage with wrap-around? -> original no problem
    as #outstanding less than 4G, now could be problem from first wrap-around
    on!

* Outline for modifcations to object.h
  + Place XXdep_traits values (tags) on full_frame, not on stack_frame
    - implies runtime-configured maximum amount of space
    -> this seems impossible.

* It seems that copying memory arguments in split_stub would have the
  benefit that we can reuse the separately allocated args and tags
  when converting from pending to stack by simply copying the pointer.
  Question is how important the calling convention optimization really is.

* NUMA on internal structures: remember which memory they are comming from and return to a thread close to that memory!


* Do not call get_ready_right_child() and do not take lock if !all_children_done()

* Reconsider lock on top in spawn_deque -> Does it harm performance? Can we avoid it somehow?
* Do profiling on smpss benchmark to determine how frequently rchild_stealing works without
  having to go through the parent...

* ready state for objects inherited by full_frame, not stack_frame
  + this does not seem to be helpfull because we will need to arg_grab() in convert_to_full(),
    and so we'll need the list of objects anyway.
  + but we could bypass arg_ready() when in a stack_frame - it should always be satisfied.
    arg_grab() and arg_release() we need to do to avoid the convert.
  + or, we could make the list but not do arg_grab() nor arg_release() unless if the frame
    is full.
* object: replace explicit reference count by deducing from other variables? (compare to above)
* object: move to arg_grab_if_ready() interface while you're touching it!

* do we need two lists for pending/ready children?
* can we remove state fs_pending (if we do not need 2 lists)
* design option: first execute ready postponed before provably-good-stealing parent
  - non-issue: choices are exclusive
  - but we could also try to execute ready pending children before continuing on
    a spawn or a call (or a leaf-call).
  - in what order pending children stored + executed?
  - lock-free implementation of pending linked list...

* Make it a compile-time flag to use secure free list for stack_frame or not
