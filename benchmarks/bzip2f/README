Description of the benchmark

bzip2 is a popular package for file compression.

Parallelization using Cilk++
bzip2 compresses blocks rather than infinite byte streams. Cilk++ bzip2 compresses several blocks in parallel. Even though the compression can run in parallell, the compressed data must be written in order. A block can be written immediately only if all earlier blocks have been written. Otherwise it must be held in memory until earlier blocks are done. Cilk++ bzip2 implements this behavior in Cilk++ using a data structure called stream reducer.

Notes hvdieren:
Base version is bzip2_1.0.5
